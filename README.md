# GODE: Graph fourier transform based Outlier Detection using Emprical Bayesian thresholding

## Propare Dataset

### Simulation

In a Jupyter Notebook, you can create datasets that are used in research.

### Real Data

You can download an earthquake dataset from the [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/). 

This dataset covers a span of 5 years, from 2010 to 2014.

### Files

We upload two files

1. The file named `Other Methods` contains the definitions of the methods that were employed in our research.

2. The file named `GODE` encompasses all the results of our research, including both simulations and real data analysis. We hope that you attempt to utilize this code for further exploration.
